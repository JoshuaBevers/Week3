      So, look, here is the deal. I'm a developing developer.

      I own a ferret, and have a deep appreciation of terrible puns. I ask more
      questions than I probably should, which is why I know more about telling
      the age of a lobster than the average joe. IT'LL BE RELEVENT ONE DAY, I
      SWEAR!

      I have an enjoyment of board games and puzzles. Once I'm presented with an
      issue I'll gnaw on it until I've come up with a solution that either
      satisfies or asks a more interesting question.

      I play a couple of instruments and am learning to speak Japanese(their
      culture is pretty neat).

      I like to learn and understand. Unfortunately I'm not gifted with tongues
      and am pretty slow to pick up oral languages, but I'm pretty persistant,
      even if I butcher the accent.

      I play piano and am teaching myself to play the guitar. Youtube is a
      pretty great resource for learning.
